# 3D-Siddon-Algorithm

Siddon algorithm is a ray tracing algorithm developed by Richard L. Siddon in 1985. Algorithm determines the voxel indices intersecting by ray path along image array. In medical imaging applications, the radiological path cannot be fully evaluated and its calculations take time because of the 3D geometry and the large amount of CT data. There are also difficulties in identifying the weight parameter of very large voxels. Although this approach seems to be simple in geometry, it actually requires significant operations with the total number of voxels. For these reasons, Siddon offered new exact algorithm. Algorithm provides the fastest calculation time and exact results. Also, it is easy to implementation of algoritm to code.
